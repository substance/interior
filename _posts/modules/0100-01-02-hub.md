Anyone can create a free account on the Substance.io server and start publishing their content online in one click straight from the Composer. You can think of it as an open document repository from where you will be able to manage your published content, add it to existing networks, find other peopleâ€™s public documents or export yours in any imaginable format (print, web, tablet, mobile and more).

<!--## Networks

Documents can be published to topic-related networks, so people can find them easily. Substance users can subscribe to Networks, so they can see new documents as well as updates made to existing ones. We're aware that today we're overwhelmed by the precesence of [too much information](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload), so our goal is letting the user decide what to see and what not to see.

## Less noise

Substance is optimized for distraction-free exploring and reading. We're trying to only add what's indispenable, and leave out everything else. Importantly, you won't see any ads while reading a document. Never.

# Substance API

Substance is exposing a simple API so you can process Substance documents in your own application.

Here's what you can do:

- Create a publication programmatically: The document will show up at Substance.io
- Update an existing publication with new content
- Search for documents
- Delete a document or specific version
- Create a new user at Substance.io
- Update user details


## Authentication

There are two ways to authenticate through Substance API v1.

### Basic Authentication

    $ curl -u "username" https://substance.io/api/v1

### Using a token

    $ curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR-TOKEN" https://substance.io/api/v1

Tokens can be obtained using OAuth for web-applications, or our secure authenication service for native apps.
