# The Substance Application

Below you can see the lastest dev-build of the **Substance** application. We're working out the kinks to provide you with a solid release as soon as possible.

# Keyboard navigation

Not only Substance keeps the UI-noise as low as possible, it also can also controlled via keyboard. There are shortcuts for adding, moving and deleting content elements, as well as for working with annotations and comments.

# Fast

Substance is fast. With Substance all operations are performed locally, giving it a huge speed advantage on centralized systems that constantly have to communicate with a server somewhere. The Substance editor applies operations locally first, then distributes the changes over the network.

# Secure

Documents are stored locally on your computer. They are safe and secure until you hit publish and replciate them with a trusted Substance Hub.
